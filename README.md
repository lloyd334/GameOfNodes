# GameOfNodes
Data used for analysis in my Master's dissertation.

The foundational data was the same as used in [Andrew Beveridge's Network of Thrones blog](https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com), and which he provides in [his GitHub repository](https://github.com/mathbeveridge/gameofthrones).

The 'full' network provided here combines Beveridge's networks from seasons 1-7, and the 'core' network is simply a subgraph from the full network containing the top 50 nodes by degree centrality.
