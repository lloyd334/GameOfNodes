# GameOfNodes
Data used for analysis in my Master's dissertation for the University of Manchester.

The foundational data was the same as used in [Andrew Beveridge's Network of Thrones blog](https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com), which he provides in [his GitHub repository](https://github.com/mathbeveridge/gameofthrones).

The 'full' network provided here is an undirected and weighted adjacency matrix in .csv format combining Beveridge's networks from seasons 1-7, and the 'core' network is simply a subgraph from the full network containing the top 50 nodes by degree centrality, presented in the same format. Also provided are node atributes for the core network (birth house, allegiance, culture and religion), which were obtained from the [GoT Wiki](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Wiki).
